# Covid-19-Analysis-Visualisation-
A data science project I did while I was at BU

I took COVID-19 data for Mexico, UK, and Russia. Separated the data by weeks, assigned labels (green - less average number of deaths, red - more average number of deaths), calculated average number of new deaths per week and standard deviation. Then I implemented kNN and Gaussian Naive Bayesian algorithms to predict labels for Russia using UK, and Mexico data, analysed and visualised the findings.
